<h3 id="Travel">Travel, Overland map</h3>
<p><b>Map is divided into squares.</b> every few squares equals one day distance of travel they need a days ration and rest for.</p>
<p><b>Sight</b> characters often know the lay of the land. Yet in unfamiliar territory reveal 1 tile in each direction from the party.</p>
<p><b>Break Neck Pace.</b> characters can double the amount of movement per day if they move at a break neck pace. Every con modifier days at break neck pace characters gain a level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>
<b>Square types: mov amt per day.</b>
<ul>
<li>Open grassland or farmland: 2.</li>
<li>Road: 3.</li>
<li>Restricted: 1. (Mountains, Dense forests, Swamp, i.e.)</li>
<li>Search area: 1. (Trying to find something in one square.)</li>
<li>Town: 3. Same as road.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Foraging</b> finding water or food. Depending on the square types they are moving in or ending upon they can use forage instead of rations and reserves of water. Chart below gives DC wis (survival) in square type of getting forage.</p>
<p><b>Table below</b> Square types: DC wis (survival) check finding food human/mount : DC wis check finding water. Only one person makes the check, if they fail they lose that day foraging following that person through the square.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open grassland or farmland : Food, DC 14/5, h/m : Water, DC 10.</li>
<li>Farmland : (for 6sp a farmer lead/provides them forage)</li>
<li>Road : copies surrounding terrain, unless they meet travelers.</li>
<li>Forest light : Food, DC 12/5, h/m : Water, DC 5.</li>
<li>Forest heavy : Food, DC 10/5, h/m : Water, DC 5.</li>
<li>Town : (If end day on town, can spend lifestyle cost for food/drink that day)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Exhaustion and Starvation.</b> Char needs 1 pound of food per day per str modifier. 1 gallon of water on a reg day, 2 gallons on hot day, every day without water is 2 levels of exhaustion. Half water is one level. Long rest with food and drink removes 1 level. Levels stack as exhaustion increases. Go without food 3 +con modifier days. Eating one reg day resets Exhaustion lvl. Char with neg str modifiers divide by mod, ie -2 divide by 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Disadvantage on ability checks.</li>
<li>Speed halved.</li>
<li>Disadvantage on attack and saving throws.</li>
<li>Speed to 0.</li>
<li>Death.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Difficult terrain</b>, every foot costs 1 extra. Multiple things in the a space counts as difficult terrain. Another creature counts as difficult terrain. You can move through a non-hostile creatures space. If hostile you can only move through their space if they are 2 sizes smaller or bigger. If creature not 2 sizes smaller or bigger create an attack of opportunity. Can't end move in their space.</p>

<p><b>Long Jump</b> move feet distance equal to Str if covered 10 feet before, if not half Str. Low obstacle, Str(athletics) 10DC to clear, else you hit it. If landing in difficult terrain, DC 10 Dex(acrobatics), succeed land on feet else prone.</p>

Don't fall prone within 5ft.</p>
<p><b>Control mount</b> non intelligent mounts can take a dash, disengage, and dodge action, with initiative same as rider. Intelligent can do what it wants with its own initiative, attack of opportunity on either mount or rider.</p>
<p><b>Underwater</b> if the creature has no natural swimming speed makes attack at disadvantage unless from dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. Ranged attack disadvantaged at normal, no attack at long unless crossbow, net or thrown weapon like javelin.</p>
