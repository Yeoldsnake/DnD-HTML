<h3 id="Travel">Travel, Overland map</h3>
<p><b>Map is divided into squares.</b> every few squares equals one day distance of travel they need a days ration and rest for.</p>
<p><b>Sight</b> characters often know the lay of the land. Yet in unfamiliar territory reveal 1 tile in each direction from the party.</p>
<p><b>Break Neck Pace.</b> characters can double the amount of movement per day if they move at a break neck pace. Every con modifier days at break neck pace characters gain a level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>
<b>Square types: mov amt per day.</b>
<ul>
<li>Open grassland or farmland: 2.</li>
<li>Road: 3.</li>
<li>Restricted: 1. (Mountains, Dense forests, Swamp, i.e.)</li>
<li>Search area: 1. (Trying to find something in one square.)</li>
<li>Town: 3. Same as road.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Foraging</b> finding water or food. Depending on the square types they are moving in or ending upon they can use forage instead of rations and reserves of water. Chart below gives DC wis (survival) in square type of getting forage.</p>
<p><b>Table below</b> Square types: DC wis (survival) check finding food human/mount : DC wis check finding water. Only one person makes the check, if they fail they lose that day foraging following that person through the square.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open grassland or farmland : Food, DC 14/5, h/m : Water, DC 10.</li>
<li>Farmland : (for 6sp a farmer lead/provides them forage)</li>
<li>Road : copies surrounding terrain, unless they meet travelers.</li>
<li>Forest light : Food, DC 12/5, h/m : Water, DC 5.</li>
<li>Forest heavy : Food, DC 10/5, h/m : Water, DC 5.</li>
<li>Town : (If end day on town, can spend lifestyle cost for food/drink that day)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Exhaustion and Starvation.</b> Char needs 1 pound of food per day per str modifier. 1 gallon of water on a reg day, 2 gallons on hot day, every day without water is 2 levels of exhaustion. Half water is one level. Long rest with food and drink removes 1 level. Levels stack as exhaustion increases. Go without food 3 +con modifier days. Eating one reg day resets Exhaustion lvl. Char with neg str modifiers divide by mod, ie -2 divide by 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Disadvantage on ability checks.</li>
<li>Speed halved.</li>
<li>Disadvantage on attack and saving throws.</li>
<li>Speed to 0.</li>
<li>Death.</li>

Unless no one is on guard, then they are all surprised. The terrain can either have some thicket on the edge of a road, or a corn field on the edge of a road.

<p><b>At the back of the house</b> is a cave which I have drawn a map for. Characters can take a short break if they want.</p>

<p><b>Tunnel A</b> is large enough for them to stand in. Once they reach the back.</p>

<p><b>Read.</b> at the back of the house you find a tunnel it is dark and completely made of raw exposed earth. After walking down the damp dark tunnel, you find there in a large circular room is a pit. It has a earthen walkway descending from the top to the bottom counter clock wise and reeks of the metallic scent of blood. Bones and animal fragments litter the floor at the bottom of the pit, and as your light starts to invade the pit you hear the yowling of kobolds.</p>
<p><b>4-6 kobolds attack</b> from the bottom room b.</p>
<p><b>Short rest</b> if the characters want before moving on.</p>

<p><b>Read</b> after a short break, you find another small earthen tunnel in which a deeply wet musty stink hits you like a slap in the face. You must enter into the dank tunnel on your hands in knees because of its small size.</p>
<p><b>Tunnel C</b> the characters have to crawl down because its too small. At the end whoever is in front must make DC 14 wis (perception) save or they fall into a concealed pit, taking 1d8 damage which they fall head first into.</p>

<p><b>Read</b> you crawl out into a slightly bigger room, where you find the wet musty stink to be groups of kobold eggs in a shallow pool all in the center of the room. The eggs shake and shimmy and gleam with movement as it is obvious they are about to hatch.</p>
<p><b>Room D</b> if the players enter the room without falling into the trap they catch the kobolds by surprise. 1-2 kobolds are on each of the landings on the north south sides of the room, 1 kobold on each landing will enter the eggs and quickly help the hatchlings out of the eggs. 5 groups of 3 eggs are X'ed on the map. Any kobolds hatched just attack the players. They don't hatch more eggs, and hatched kobolds only have half hp, 2. It takes the birthing kobolds a whole action to help a group of 3 out of the eggs. The eggs themselves have 1hp and an AC of 5.</p>

<p><b>Short rest</b> give them a chance to rest.</p>

<p><b>Room E</b> is another tunnel leading which they have to crawl down, at the middle is a hidden treasure stash. Make a DC 12 wis (perception) check to see if they notice the false wall at the triangle on the map. At the other end is another pit filled with kobold poop. Give the characters one more chance to notice the stash on the way out.</p>
<p><b>Hidden stash contents</b> 340 silver, 480 copper.</p>

<p><b>Short rest</b> give the characters a chance for a short rest though that is the end of the tunnel. Then they get attacked by the harpy and 4 kobolds outside the hovel as they exit. Just the dirt path outside in the fire light, 30ft distance to the harpy.</p>

<p><b>Read</b> once you collect yourself at end of the cave and have had a short rest, you hear some oddly beguiling music coming from outside the hovel. It sounds like the vocals of a chanting young lady. You step outside and see a harpy there drawing along a group of kobolds like puppies on a leash. Her whole body heaves in the rhythm of her chant as she floats flapping 10ft above the kobolds. At once she glances up and looks at the party, her music stops and the kobolds snap alert as if out of a trance. And then a grating sharp scream assaults your ears as she commands the kobolds to attack.</p>
